This is a really cool concept for a 1930s RPG campaign setting! A few thoughts on how you could develop the storyline:

- Secret organizations like the Society in our earlier prompt are racing to understand and control this new arcane energy source. Some aims are noble, others nefarious.

- Strange manifestations of uncontrolled energy have started popping up around the world - eerie glows in rural towns, floating objects in the cities after dark. Scientists are baffled. 

- A few rare individuals are discovering they have an innate ability to harness this energy without equipment. But it's wild and unpredictable. One accidentally destroys a laboratory. Another makes a small town disappear. 

- Governments want to weaponize it, but testing has dangerous side effects as they push the boundaries of what humans can channel. Radiation sickness is appearing.

- There are rumors of obscure occult groups who seem to know more than they're letting on. Are they harnessing it in secret through ancient rituals? Or are they responsible for its emergence?

- Your player characters could each unwittingly start developing arcane abilities as the campaign progresses. They'll need to learn control while exploring the energy's origins.

Let me know if any of those ideas are useful as potential plot hooks or directions for your campaign setting. I'm enjoying thinking through how to realistically introduce this new magical technology to an otherwise historical world.



Ooh I like the idea of a strange remote location triggering the start of the story better. Here's a revised opening scene proposal then:

You're called to an emergency meeting at the Society's London headquarters. Word has just come in of bizarre weather in the Austrian Alps - massive hail despite clear skies, and odd flashes seen above the remote mountain village of Kruezberg. 

The Society suspects this could be connected to the growing arcane energy phenomena. They're sending a team to investigate. As the most promising new recruits, you've been selected for this dangerous mission. 

After an arduous journey by train and charter plane, you finally arrive in Kruezberg under darkening storm clouds. The village is in a panic - windows are blown out, equipment damaged. Strange murmurs come from the woods. As night falls, an eerie glow emanates from the peaks... It's clear something primal has been stirred in this place. Your investigation begins at dawn.

How's that revised opening scene set in a remote foreign location? Still provides a mystery hook but grounds the larger storyline in the Society's London headquarters as a base of operations. Let me know if any part of the scene could be improved!



Here's a summary of the developing backstory:

The Society is a secretive organization based in London that investigates paranormal/occult phenomena. Their monitoring equipment has been detecting minor anomalous energy spikes originating from the remote Austrian mountain village of Kruezberg over time. 

Intrigued but not wanting to operate overtly in such a small town yet, the Society sent one of their "assets" - likely a local contact or sensitive - to quietly monitor the situation from the ground. 

When a massive arcane energy disturbance hits Kruezberg, causing strange weather and damage, this asset immediately reports the major incident directly to the Society. At the same time, their equipment registers an enormous spike from the same region.

Concerned this could be related to the growing energy phenomenon they've been studying, the Society assembles an expedition team of their most promising young recruits (the player characters). Their goal is to secretly investigate what occurred in Kruezberg and determine if it's connected to the larger mysteries surrounding the source and effects of arcane power.

And that's how the setting and situation is established for the opening scene and adventure prompt! Please let me know if any part of the summary needs clarification or modification.



I absolutely love the comparison to Holmes and Moriarty - that's a perfect analogy for the type of nemesis relationship between the Society and this shadowy exploiter organization. With that in mind:

- While this may be the first direct confrontation, I'm sure Society intelligence has suspected for a while there is some rich and powerful group covertly trying to manipulate supernatural/magical forces behind the scenes. 

- Rumors and whispers from other parts of the globe have hinted at a "hidden hand" meddling in curious occult incidents, always just out of reach. 

- The Society sees it as their duty to ensure such powers aren't abused by those seeking control or profit. They've been wary another player was emerging on the field.

- Now with this major event, the two organizations are colliding head on as they both rush to investigate. It will be an early showdown between opposing minds and motives.

I love the idea that while new to directly facing off, the Society has sized up they were facing an equally cunning nemesis pulling strings from the shadows. Really creates an engrossing atmosphere of shadow wars and occult intrigues!



Excellent question! Let's think through who this shadowy nemesis could be:

- Probably a figure of significant wealth and influence, using front companies/aliases to hide their activities. 

- Likely European aristocrat/industrialist background to move in elite circles and fund global operations. 

- Potential backstory of always being drawn to esoteric/occult subjects as a child, spurred them to seek truth behind supernatural mysteries.

- Now middle-aged but still vigorous, with a network of henchmen/agents doing their bidding across borders. 

- Name could be something foreboding but historically plausible, like Baron Vladimir Strigoi or Francois Laveau.  

- Has a lavish hidden base of operations, well-staffed library of dark lore. Treats the hunt as an indulgent game against worthy foes like the Society.

- Charismatic and formidably intelligent, sees self as one chosen to wield and profit from arcane forces for a new dynasty.

Any thoughts or suggestions on fleshing out this nefarious occult antagonist further? Getting a strong sense of their background and motivations will help bring them to life as an enduring rival.



I love these additions to flesh out the antagonist - very compelling motivations. Some thoughts integrating it all:

- The Laveau family has held immense wealth and influence in Europe for generations, acquired through trade but also whispered "gifts".

- Their ancestors were missionaries who brought back esoteric knowledge/artifacts from the New World, sparking a lifelong quest.

- Francois heads the family now, convinced their explorations have led to clues about unlocking ultimate power/knowledge from Precursor civilizations. 

- He believes harnessing arcane forces could be the key to obtaining whatever ancient secrets/abilities his forebears sought.

- With wealth and fascination with the arcane, the Laveaus have quietly funded global experiments for decades.

- Francois sees the current surge as a sign they're closing in, and won't let anyone interfere with his destiny-driven plans to change the world through these powers.

- The Society antagonizes him as obstacles to his grand vision, while he views them as naive meddlers unable to comprehend what's at stake.

Does this help flesh out the shadowy Laveau family and Francois as a complex, wealthy yet deeply committed antagonist pursuing world-shaping goals? Really elevates the stakes of the conflict.



Here's a summary of the key elements we've established for the campaign setting and antagonists:

- Strange surges in mysterious arcane energy are being detected worldwide in the late 1930s. 

- The secretive London-based Society investigates paranormal activity tied to this phenomenon. 

- Their monitoring equipment detected minor anomalies in Kruezberg, Austria, leading them to place an "asset" there.

- A massive storm/disturbance hits Kruezberg, drawing the attention of the Society and others.

- The wealthy Laveau family has secretly funded occult experiments for generations, led by Francois Laveau. 

- They believe these energies could unlock ancient secrets and abilities from precursor civilizations.

- Francois sees the current events as bringing them closer to this world-changing goal. 

- The Society and Laveaus have been adversaries for some time, both investigating the arcane but with opposing motives - knowledge vs power.

- The player characters are Society agents sent to covertly investigate the major Kruezberg incident, colliding directly with the Laveaus there for the first time.

Let me know if any part needs adjustment - I think this gives a great foundation for an intriguing 1930s occult/mystery campaign setting and overarching plotlines.



Ooh I really like that alternative - the death of a powerful channeler triggering the massive release. That does raise the stakes even more with loss of life already involved. And then discovering they had a child who may now be manifesting abilities adds a strong new angle as well.

Some thoughts incorporating that idea:

- Villagers are shaken by massive storm that resulted in damage/injuries 
- Society asset reports to them that the storm's epicenter was focused on one home
- Upon investigating, they find the body of the deceased channeler amid signs of arcane energy discharge
- Learning this person had a son/daughter who is now displaying strange phenomena themselves
- Child is experiencing grief but also fear/wonder over what's happening to them
- Other characters like the parents could be protective but also wanting answers
- Adds thread of the party trying to unravel what killed the parent and prevent it happening to the child
- Really good seeds of mystery, emotion and protective motivation woven into the adventure kick-off.

Let me know if you want to develop/modify any part of incorporating that new plot twist regarding the deceased parent into the initial scenario details. I think it enriches things nicely.
