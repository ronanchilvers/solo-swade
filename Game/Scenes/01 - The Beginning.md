> **Location:** Zephyria 
> **Weather:** Night time - warm and clear
> **Chaos Factor:** 5
> **Scene Type:** Expected 

- [[Rakim]] sets off across the desert towards the [[Amber Dunes]]
	- He is following a spice road
	- He is riding his camel [[Faris]] and also has a pack camel, [[Elgiva]]
	- He has enough food for a couple of weeks travel and plenty of water
	- He leaves at night to take advantage of the cooler temperatures
- It is about 2 days journey to the [[Amber Dunes]]

> [!oracle] Does the first day go as expected?
> **Roll:** 44 (50/59)
> **Outcome:** Yes
> **Random Event:** NPC Action

- Around midnight he sees up ahead a camel train
	- There are 5 or 6 camels, plodding slowly along the road, their loads swaying gently
	- Rakim can see that each of the camels bears a figure
- The rearmost camel is ridden by a figure dressed in a simple monks habit

> [!oracle] Is there any danger in the camel train?
> **Roll:** 24
> **Outcome:** Yes 
> **Random Event:** None
> **Meaning:** Majestically Modern, Energize Plot

> [!roll] Test - Stealth
> **Result:** 5

- [[Rakim]] rides slowly behind the camel train for a while before urging Faris into a faster trot and catching it up
- The camel train riders seem to be unaware of him until he calls out to them
- The rearmost rider jumps, turns in his saddle and seeing Rakim approaching, shouts to the others
	- They immediately rouse their camels into a run
	- The train begins to gallop, haphazardly along the roadway
- The rearmost rider turns his camel and blocks the roadway, challenging Rakim
	- "How are you? Why do you stop us? We have no gold or anything worth your time to look!"
- The man's voice is hoarse and nervous
- Rakim holds out his hands
	- "I mean no harm - I simply greet you as a fellow traveller on the spice roads. Where are you bound?"
- The man is suspicious

> [!oracle] Does Abdul have a weapon?
> **Roll:** 30
> **Outcome:** No 
> **Random Event:** None

- He calls out - "We are bound north, towards [[Camshae]]. And you traveller? Where are you bound?"

> [!oracle] Are the Amber Dunes to the north?
> **Roll:** 7
> **Outcome:** Extreme Yes 
> **Random Event:** None

- Rakim rides a little closer and answers - "I am making for the Amber Dunes, due north of here. Do you know of them?"

> [!oracle] Has Abdul heard of the Amber Dunes?
> **Roll:** 98
> **Outcome:** Extreme No 
> **Random Event:** None

- The man shakes his head - "The name is unfamiliar to me but I am not from these parts."
- Rakim - "May I ride with you a while? The night is young and my road is a long and sometimes lonely one. It would be good to have some company on the road, at least for a short while. I may be able to guide your route a little - I know these roads well."

> [!roll] Test - Does Abdul agree? Persuasion
> **Result:** 2

- The man shakes his head - "My companions are nervous of strangers - they are not used to the rigours of the road and I am afraid the presence of a stranger would unsettle them. We were about to rest anyway"
	- He turns and whistles long and loud
	- The shapes of the fleeing members of the camel train draw up and stop some distance ahead
- Rakim - "I am Rakim. Might I know your name my friend? It might be that we will meet again and I would like to be able to greet you by name."
- The man replies - "I am Abdul, Father Abdul. I wish you a safe journey to your destination Rakim"
- Rakim - "And you Father Abdul"
- Rakim gees Faris into a trot and rides on up the road, passing the others after a minute or two. He nods a greeting to them as he passes.

> [!oracle] Does the rest of the night pass as expected?
> **Roll:** 27
> **Outcome:** Yes 
> **Random Event:** None

- Just after dawn Rakim stops and prepares a camp
	- He cooks a meal and settles down to rest

> [!oracle] Does anything happen during the day?
> **Roll:** 18
> **Outcome:** Yes 
> **Random Event:** None

> [!info] Sandstorm
> While Rakim rests, some miles to the north, a wind begins to pick up. Soon the wind has become a gale and the sands of the [[Amber Dunes]] begin to shift and move. The storm rises, torrents of wind blown sand billowing upwards to form a moving wall. The massive sandstorm tears southwards across the desert plains.

> [!roll] Test - Does Rakim wake up before the storm arrives in earnest?
> **Result:** Notice - 3

- Some time later Rakim wakes to the noise of high winds
	- Climbs a nearby dune and looking North, sees the rapidly approaching darkness of the sandstorm
	- He knows he must either find shelter or try to outrun the storm

> [!roll] Test - Does Rakim find shelter nearby?
> **Result:** Survival - 12

> [!oracle] Is there shelter nearby?
> **Roll:** 14 (Nearly certain)
> **Outcome:** Extreme yes
> **Random Event:** None

- Rakim runs down the dune, gathers his belongings as quickly as he can and climbs into the saddle
- He spurs [[Faris]] and [[Elgiva]] into a gallop
	- After a few minutes of hard galloping an outcropping of rocks a little distance away
	- The storm rages behind them coming ever closer

> [!oracle] Can he reach the rocks before the storm hits?
> **Roll:** 93 (Nearly certain)
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

- He rides hard but begins to feel the wind at his back
- Sand begins to whip up ahead of him as he gallops
- They reach the rocks as the first blasts of the sandstorm hit them, pelting them fierce torrents of grit
- Rakim struggles to lead the two camels in among the rocks

> [!roll] Test - Pull the two camels in among the rocks
> **Result:** Survival - 13

- He hauls on the reins, leading the frightened animals in among the rocks
- He finds a cave entrance, large enough to admit him and the camels
- He pushes inside and after a few minutes struggling with the camels reins, he makes it into the cave and out of the storm
- The cave is spacious, opening out into a flat floored chamber

> [!oracle] Is there fuel for a fire here?
> **Roll:** 97 (50/50)
> **Outcome:** No
> **Random Event:** None

- The cave is cool and dry but empty of anything which might aid lighting a fire
- Rakim settles down as close to the entrance as he can to wait out the storm

> [!oracle] Does the storm last longer than a day?
> **Roll:** (Unlikely) 91
> **Outcome:** Extreme no
> **Random Event:** None

- To Rakim's relief the storm blows it self out within the hour - it was violent but short lived
- He climbs the rock to make sure of where he is

> - [!roll] Test - Determine his position
> **Result:** Survival - 5

- He manages to work out the way back to the roadway he was following 
- He climbs down, retrieves the camels and after checking their cargo he mounts and sets off
