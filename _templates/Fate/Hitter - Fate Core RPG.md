> - **Good / +3** - Fight / Shoot
> - **Fair / +2** - Sneak / Deceive / Athletics

> [!abstract] Stunts
> - When you attack with Shoot and invoke an aspect representing careful aim, you gain Weapon:2 on the attack.
> - Provided you havenâ€™t been spotted by your target yet, you can attack with Sneak instead of Fight.
> - By spending a fate point, you can make yourself vanish from the scene entirely. Then, at the end of any later turn, you can spend another fate point to make yourself reappear anywhere in the scene and immediately attack.
