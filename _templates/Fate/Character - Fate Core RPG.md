> [!question]- Stress and Consequences
> Every PC has two different stress tracks. The physical stress track deals with physical harm, and the mental stress track mitigates mental harm. The more boxes in a stress track, the more resilient the character is in that regard. By default, a character has two boxes in each stress track.
> 
> Every PC also has three consequence slots. One is mild, one is moderate, and the last one is severe. Unlike stress, these aren’t classified as either physical or mental - any of them can apply to any type of harm. As mentioned above, consequences are the injuries and traumas you can’t just shake off after the dust settles.
>
> Certain skills and some stunts can add to these defaults. See the Skills and Stunts chapter for more on that. For the sake of quick reference, these are the skills in Hearts of Steel that alter stress and consequences:
> 
> Physique helps with physical stress, and Will helps with mental stress. Either skill grants: 
> - one more stress box of the respective type (physical or mental) if rated at Average (+1) or Fair (+2)
> - two more stress boxes of the respective type (physical or mental) if rated at Good (+3) or higher
> - an additional mild consequence slot at Superb (+5) or higher
> 
> Unlike the standard three, this con- sequence slot is specifically restricted to either physical harm (Physique) or mental harm (Will).

> [!todo]- Choosing Skills 
> Your skills form a pyramid, with a single skill rated at Great (+4) - your peak skill - and more skills at each lower rating on the ladder going down to Average (+1):
> 
> - One Great (+4) skill
> - Two Good (+3) skills
> - Three Fair (+2) skills
> - Four Average (+1) skills
> 
> Mediocre (+0) is the default  for any skill you do not take.

> [!todo]- Creating Aspects
> Your high concept is a phrase that sums up what your character is about - who he is and what he does. It’s an aspect, one of the first and most important ones for your character.
> 
> Think of this aspect like your job, your role in life, or your calling - it’s what you’re good at, but it’s also a duty you have to deal with, and it’s constantly filled with problems of its own. That is to say, it comes with some good and some bad.
> 
> In addition to a high concept, every character has some sort of trouble aspect that’s a part of his life and story. If your high concept is what or who your character is, your trouble is the answer to a simple question: what complicates your character’s existence?

> [!todo]- Choosing Stunts
> Pick or invent ***three to five stunts***. Determine how many fate points you start play with. Stunts change how skills work for your character. Picking and inventing stunts are covered in the Skills and Stunts chapter.
> 
> You get ***three stunts for free***, and you can take up to ***two more stunts*** at the cost of ***lowering your refresh by one each***. The idea is the more cool tricks you can do, the more you’ll need to accept compels to get fate points. Figuring out stunts can take a while, so you may want to pick one for now and determine the rest of them during play.
> 
> A player character in Fate starts with a refresh of 3. That means he’ll start each session off with at least 3 fate points. If you pick four stunts, your refresh is 2. If you pick five stunts, your refresh is 1. Regardless of how stunts work in your game, you can never have a refresh lower than 1.
