> [!todo]- Aspects
> Your high concept is a phrase that sums up what your character is about— who he is and what he does. It’s an aspect, one of the first and most important ones for your character.
> Think of this aspect like your job, your role in life, or your calling—it’s what you’re good at, but it’s also a duty you have to deal with, and it’s constantly filled with problems of its own. That is to say, it comes with some good and some bad.
