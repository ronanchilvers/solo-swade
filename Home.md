> [!abstract] Starting Scene
> While many western countries are excited about the new researches into electro-arcane energy, there are those who fear it's power. They fear that we don't yet understand the true source of the newly discovered powers. They fear that it may not be what it seems and that we are on the brink of calamity.
> The Society of Curious Personages is a group of skeptics formed in London in 1928, which aims to discover the truth. Word has reached London of a strange event high in the Ural mountains of Russia. A single page from a diary carried by one of the Society's most trusted members, revealed a discovery so shocking that it was scarcely credible. Were it not for the reputation of the diary's owner, it would have been discarded.
> Darius Fisher, already an experienced explorer and eager for adventure, leaves London on the express train bound for Dover. He is booked on the overnight boat to Ostend and from there he takes a train bound east for Moscow. His task is to discover the truth.
