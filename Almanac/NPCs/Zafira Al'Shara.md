Zafira is an elegant and regal woman in her middle 60s with a statuesque figure, her skin bearing the warm bronze tones of someone well-acquainted with the desert sun, her eyes a deep and piercing emerald green, and her long, obsidian hair cascading like a river of midnight silk down her back.

She resides on the grand boulevard known as "Oasis Shalimar." Her opulent mansion overlooks the street and the lush gardens, fountains, and palaces that define this prestigious thoroughfare in Zephyria.
